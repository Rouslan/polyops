=====================

.. cpp:namespace:: poly_ops


Macros
------------------

.. c:macro:: POLY_OPS_HAVE_128BIT_INT

    If :cpp:class:`basic_int128` is defined, this has a value of 1. Otherwise,
    this is 0.

Types
------------------

.. cpp:class:: basic_int128

    A signed 128-bit integer.

    This only supports some of the operations that built-in integers support:
    addition, subtraction, negation and comparison. Multiplication and bit-wise
    operations are absent. Additionally, the standard library will not recognize
    this class as an integer (e.g.: ``std::is_integer<poly_ops::basic128>`` will
    have a value of `false`).
