polyops
================================

A header-only C++ library for boolean and inset/outset operations on polygons
with integer coordinates.

**Notice:** This is a work in progress. Many features are missing and the
interface may change drastically between versions. If you are looking for a
mature library, I recommend
[Clipper2](https://github.com/AngusJohnson/Clipper2).
